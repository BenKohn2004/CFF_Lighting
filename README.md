A brief repository to hold CFF Lighting Code

Two Files, one transmits from a Favero Full Arm 05, but has a retransmit of 10 milliseconds due to lag. Probably not the ideal solution but seems to work well enough to minimize lag from lights on the box to the lights on the strip.

The Second file controls a double relay that will click on or off the LED lights on the strip.
